# Binary-Image-Classification-with-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning
Can we classify Asian or African Elephants from images without knowing too much about their characteristics, shape, behaviour etc. It may take some days or weeks to find out dissimilarities and the key characteristics. Luckily, with the help of the Convolutional Neural Network, we do not need to be an expert. With some knowledge of coding with CNN we can classify them very accurately.In this case study, I try to classify two different types of **Elephant** by using testing several deep learning model. Our transfer learning model is able to classify two different **Elephants** types.  The accuracy in our case is almost 90%.
