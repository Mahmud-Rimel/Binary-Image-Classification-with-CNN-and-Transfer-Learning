# Binary-Image-Classification-with-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning
Can You classify  Asian Elephants or African Elephants from images without knowing too much about their characteristics, shape, behaviour etc.? I bet you cannot. It may take some days or weeks to find out dissimilarities and the key characteristics. Luckily, with the help of the Convolutional Neural Network, we do not need to be an expert. With some knowledge of coding with CNN we can classify them very accurately. The accuracy in our case is almost 90%. Isn't it exciting? How easy with **CNN** and **Transfer learning** to classify Elephants from images.
